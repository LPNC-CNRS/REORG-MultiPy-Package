REORG MultiPy Package

MultiPy is a fast, user-friendly and robust "batching-like" pipeline to automatically extract several anatomo-functional brain metrics on a common parcellation/atlas.

The multi-algorithmic approach allows the processing of data “from scratch” (i.e., from the raw data), using the main recent, appropriate, widely-used and proven tools available in the neuroscientific community.

The main objective is to provide an accessible tool to handle and process multimodal MRI data (T1w, rest- and task-fMRI, dMRI) under the same standards and through a connectomic approach.
